# RPGEngine

RPGEngine plans to provide all the needed facilities for users to script their
own RPG games. RPGEngine integrates with the open source [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/),
which provides a rich environment for building worlds.

The scripting language of RPGEngine is YAML, so if you know YAML there is no
new syntax to learn.
